You need to install and test R, RStudio and FastTree before the workshop.
The installation process is simple on all major platforms, and mostly
consists of downloading and running the installers appropriate to your
platform. Please contact the instructors if you run into difficulties
so we can help you show up with a computer properly set up for the
workshop.

## FastTree

* [Install FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install), a free software. Follow the instruction given on the website

You will have to use FastTree on the terminal (MacOS and Linux) or the Command Prompt (Windows). Make sure you know where FastTree is installed on your computer so you will be able to call it in from the terminal or CommandPrompt. To test it, try to get the help pages by running from the terminal or Command Prompt:

[Path to the software]/FastTree -help 

"[Path to the software]" refers to the location of FastTree on YOUR computer (e.g. the desktop if you installed in on the desktop). For example, in my case it is FastTree is located here "Desktop/Programmes_Unix/" so that, in the terminal, I run "Desktop/Programmes_Unix/FastTree -help "


## R and RStudio

* [Install R](http://www.r-project.org), a free software environment for statistical
  computing and graphics.
      + It is _highly recommended_ to install a precompiled binary
  distribution for your operating system -- use the links up at the
  top of the page linked to above!
    + If you currently have R installed on your laptop, please make sure it is version 3.2.0 or later. *Please update if it is not!*
* [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a powerful user interface for R.

## Testing

1. Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. 
  
2. Put your cursor in the left pane labelled "Console", which is where you
  interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code
  like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). In the
  "Environment" pane, to the right of the Console, you should see an
  entry for "x" with appropriate value (in this case, 8).
  
3. Then inspect the `x` object by typing `x` in the Console followed by
  enter or return. You should see the value 8 printed to the screen.

4. Finally, check that plotting works. In the console, type
  `plot(cars)`. If you see a scatterplot appear in the "Plots" pane to the lower right,
  you are good to go.


## Add-on packages

R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they
have developed as a _package_ via the Comprehensive R Archive
  Network [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), or personal GitHub repositories. 

To install a
package in RStudio:

1. Go to the "Tools" menu and choose  "Install Packages" or click "Install" in the Packages area in the lower right pane of RStudio.
2. The following window appears: ![](images/packages_screenshot.png)
3. Enter the name of the desired package
    + The checkmark by
   "Install dependencies" should be **on**.
4. Click on the "Install" button

Please install the following packages and their dependencies for use in this workshop:

* tidyverse 
* ape
* sequinR
* vegan
* phyloseq
* betapart
* abind
* Matrix
* phytools
* ggplot2
* cowplot

Additionally, you will need to install the package `PhyloFactor`. This is not yet
available as a complete installable package on CRAN, so you will need to install
from source. To do this, execute the following commands in RStudio after you 
have installed all of the above packages.

```{r}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("ggtree")
biocLite("Biostrings")
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('reptalex/phylofactor')
```

Please make SURE that all packages are correctly installed BEFORE the workshop, by running these lines in R:

```{r}
library(seqinr)
library(ape)
library(vegan)
library(tidyverse)
library(phyloseq)
library(betapart)
library(abind)
library(tidyr)
library(Matrix)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(phylofactor)
```

IF you run into problems, email us at flo.mazel'at'gmailcom and jonsan'at'gmail.com
